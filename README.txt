This is a basic little demo of creating a very simplistic map app via mapbox and leaflet. This was created specifically for a job application and is very simplistic.

My time on this project was limited for the following reasons.

A) I may never use leaflet again, even if I land the job they will most likely make me use different libraries or software

B) I want to present a willingness to learn new knowledge and libraries but devoting too much time to just 1 job application frankly seems like poor time management.

If like the simplistic creation here I or are intrigued by my coding and would like me to create something more substantial for you please let me know here or at my email: Kylemathzeller@gmail.com




HOW TO USE:

I made this in Visual Code Studio, I recommend you open the folder there. 

Make sure you have the extension "Live Server" installed. <cntr-shift-x to access the extension menu>

Once you have the extension installed simply right-click anywhere on the screen with the index.html tab open. 

Click "Open with Live Server"

This should open up the map in whatever your default browser is set to and you can toggle on and off the markers, circles, and zones. 

All the API's, Libraries, and images belong to their respective organizations and are free to use with credit. The images belong to their respect geological points.

Thank you for looking at my project
